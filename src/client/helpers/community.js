"Communities" is a core aspect of the farmr.club ecosystem. A ulog-community is a community born around the art of farming. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
A ulog-subtag however, is a simple fusion between #farmr and a hashtag. Farmr-subtags simplifies the art of farming while maintaining its essence, by allowing users to ulog about niche-based topics. It also further incites users to be inventive with content-creation, unites existing STEEM communities by drawing "true fans" towards these communities and enhances content creation/curation. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Each ulog-subtag has the potential of emanating a ulog-community. You can take a step towards creating a ulog-community, if you are a "certified farmr". &nbsp;
&nbsp;

Visit https://farmr.club/discover to see if you are "certified". To become a "certified farmr", contact us.
